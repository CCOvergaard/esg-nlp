The results of this initial assessment, illustrated on the \n\nright\u00b9, confirm that the material topics of A.P.

Recognising \n\nour global presence and the nature of our business as an integrator \n\nof global supply chains, this is not an exhaustive list, but shows where \n\nMaersk may have the largest impacts on people and planet through our \n\nactivities, or where Maersk is exposed to the most significant financial \n\nrisks or opportunities. Some topics such as microplastics, substances  \n\nof concern, water discharges and marketing practices were identified as \n\nrelevant in the assessment but fell below the thresholds applied  \n\nfor materiality.\n\nMaersk has already for many years been guided by a double \n\nmateriality perspective as the foundation for our sustainability and \n\nESG strategy and reporting. The criteria of the European Sustainability \n\nReporting Standards (ESRS) add more rigour to the assessment through \n\na common set of requirements for how to conduct and report on double \n\nmateriality, aligning closely with recognised standards such as the OECD \n\nGuidelines on Responsible Business Practices. For example, all topics \n\nwere assessed for severity, which covers an assessment of scale, scope \nand remediable character of the topic \u2013 concepts we already apply in the \n\nidentification of our salient human rights issues. Our focus in 2023 has \n\nbeen on establishing robust methodology aligned with the approach and \n\ncriteria outlined in the ESRS. Going forward, we will continue the work \n\nto further mature, develop and refine our approach in line with best \npractice and as more guidance becomes available.

A global \n\nfuel standard of 5-10% green fuels by 2030 will ramp up the use of \n\ngreen fuels in shipping, while the GHG price addresses energy efficiency.\n\nA number of GHG pricing mechanism proposals are under \n\nconsideration, with different price points and different approaches,  \ne.g. from well-to-wake to a levy to emissions trading or feebate \n\nsystems.

The increase is mainly \ndriven by the significant decrease in revenue in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nIn 2023, we emitted 639,000 tonnes CO\u2082e biogenic emissions. These were mainly related to combustion of \nbiofuels in our vessel operations.\n\nFrom 2022 to 2023, we recorded a 1%-point increase in the share of ocean freight transported by green fuels. \nThis reflects customers\u2019 growing engagement with supply chain partners who can help realise their climate ambition.\n\nIn 2023, we improved the operational efficiency of our vessels, reducing Maersk\u2019s EEOI by 4% compared to the \n2020 baseline. This is driven by more fuel-efficient operations, continuous roll-out of efficiency technologies, \nshore power enablement and increased use of biofuels.\n\nSince 2020, APM Terminals has reduced its absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 13%. Key drivers include \nimplementation of dedicated green tariffs in European terminals and implementation of energy optimisation \ninitiatives at 12 terminals to reduce fuel and electricity use.\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nSOx\n\nNOx\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nNMVOCs\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nCO\n\nPM103\n\nPM2.5\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\n5.2\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nEnvironmental incidents\n\n6.1\n\n6.2\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nData and \nassurance\n\n4949\n\n1,000 tonnes\n\n90\n\n100\u00b9\n\n107\n\n102\n\n569\n\nSOx emissions decreased 10% in 2023 compared to 2022.

The main drivers for the decrease are due to lower volumes of heavy fuel oil \nconsumed in Ocean and the use of scrubbers, which reduce air pollutant emissions. \n\nBlack carbon emissions in 2023 is on par with 2022.\n\nThe 39% increase of Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions in 2023 compared to 2022 is driven by significantly higher \nconsumption of kerosine fuel by Maersk Air Cargo due to increased air freight volumes.\n\nBlack Carbon\n\n1,000 tonnes\n\nOther resource consumption\n\n5.1\n\nEnvironment  \nand ecosystems\n\nWaste\n\n1,000 tonnes\n\n533\n\n553\u00b9\n\n357\n\n289\n\n299\n\nWater consumption\n\n1,000 m3\n\n2,957\n\n2,504\n\n2,156\n\n1,754\n\n1,696\n\nIn 2023, we recorded a 4% decrease in waste generation from our operations. This was mainly driven by an \nincreased focus on waste reduction initiatives on our vessels. This decrease was partly offset by an increase in \nwaste in the new logistics entities LF Logistics, Senator and Pilot that were included for the first time in 2023.\n\nWater consumption increased by 18% in 2023 compared to 2022. This increase is mainly due to Maersk\u2019s \nacquisition of LF Logistics in 2022, which has significantly increased our landside footprint, and that has been \nincluded for the first time in our ESG performance data this year.\n\nHydrocarbon spills (>10 m3)\n\nContainers lost at sea\n\n#\n\n#\n\n0\n\n52\n\n0\n\n118\n\n2\n\n-\n\n2\n\n-\n\n0\n\n-\n\nIn 2023, Maersk did not record any significant oil spills (>10 m3) to the environment.\n\nIn 2023, Maersk had two container loss incidents, both occurring in December.

Hence, we see a high share of eligible revenue, Capex and Opex, but a \nsignificantly lower share of revenue, Capex and Opex related to taxonomy-aligned activities.

The ESG performance data accounting \npolicies used for the preparation of the ESG performance data are accounting \npolicies developed by the company, which Management is solely responsible for \nselecting and applying.
